# Tetris-Online
SMU CS 7319 Project


## Selected
1) Compilation & Implementation Platform:

    Platform: Python 3.8 or higher
    Where to Download: Python can be downloaded from the official Python website: python.org
    Installation & Configuration:
        Download the appropriate installer for your operating system from the Python website.
        Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python.
        Make sure to check the option to add Python to the system PATH during installation.
        Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type python --version to verify the installation.
        No additional configuration is required to run Python code.

2) Compiling the Code:

    Python code does not need to be compiled in the traditional sense. Python is an interpreted language, and its source code is executed directly by the Python interpreter.

    To ensure that your code runs without errors, make sure to have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install dependencies using pip, the Python package installer, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


    pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Executing the System:

    To execute the system, follow these steps:
    1) Navigate to the "Selected" directory containing the Python files (gui.py, game_logic.py and network.py) in your terminal or command prompt.
    2) Run the main Python file (gui.py) using the following command:


    python gui.py

This command will launch the Tetris game GUI, allowing you to interact with the system. Follow the on-screen instructions to create or join a game, and enjoy playing Tetris with other players over the network.

4) Elaborate in detail on the difference between the architecture designs for both candidate architecture styles and the rationales for your final selection.
5) 
Note: Make sure to have the necessary permissions to execute Python scripts on your system. Additionally, ensure that any firewall or network settings allow communication on the specified port (default port is 8080) if you are running the system over a network.


## Unselected
1) Compilation & Implementation Platform:
   User Python 3.8 or higher
   Also required pygame, socket, josn, and sys API.
   Use pip install ... on the ternimal

3) Executing the system:
   To execute this system, follow these steps:
   1) Open the "Unselected" directory in the python files.
   2) Run the StartPage.py to execute the system.
   3) For testing, you need to open two terminals or PowerShell and Run the StartPage.py twice. Or you can run CreateGamePage.py and PlayerConnectPage.py and use your local ip address and invite to test it.
